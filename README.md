This project is a submission project for the human resources woman of the zoomin company and it deals with fetching information of the Star Wars movies from https://swapi.dev/api/ api.
In this project I used React and designed the information as TOC table
The project must be opened by entering the correct folder through the terminal and there we will first install all the necessary modules, and after the install is finished we will run the project using npm run >npm i && npm run start
